    "This code reads in a **table of biogas sources** -- including coordinates, estimated methane production costs (`$/MMBtu`), and pipeline delivery costs (`$/mi-MMBtu @15y`) -- and a **raster cost surface**, with units of mulitpliers (in percent) applied to building a section of pipeline through that cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code iterates through each biogas source and develops a least cost distance surface away from that source such that each pixel's value represents the aggregate cost to deliver 1 MMbtu of methane and to that pixel's location. The result is a stack of these cost distance surfaces, one for each biogas source. \n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum value from the set of all cost distance surfaces represents the minimum cost to deliver methane to that site (from any source). It can be thresholded (select all cells below a set minimum cost) to identify all areas that are cost effective to connect at a set price point. This would also identify other biogas sources that, alone, are not cost effective, but when considered alongside other sites, become cost effective. \n",
    "\n",
