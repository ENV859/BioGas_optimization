# Biogas "cost-shed" analysis

### Objective

Our goal here is to identify all areas in a Duplin Co. that are cost effective to construct pipes connecting various biogas sources at a given price point. We aimed to do this by developing a surface where each pixel represents the minimum cost to deliver biogas to that location - from any biogas source. We would then be able to threshold this surface at a given cost, i.e., select all pixels below that value, and the result would reveal areas that are cost effective to connect.
